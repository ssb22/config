# This is Silas S. Brown's .gtkrc file.  Works as-is for GTK
# 1.2.  GTK 2.0 looks for this file as .gtkrc-2.0 but from
# about version 2.4.0 uses X resources instead; however it's
# still useful to have this file as a fallback because some
# versions of GTK don't do everything right from Xresources
# (e.g. I've known tooltip popups to be unreadable without
# this file).

# Where to find history:
# on GitHub at https://github.com/ssb22/config
# and on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/ssb22/config
# and on BitBucket https://bitbucket.org/ssb22/config

# NB: Order is important.  If you move "default" to the
# bottom then it will override everything else.
# (Unfortunately this also means that we can't use this to
# stop applications programmers from loading their own
# resource files or hard-coding them)
