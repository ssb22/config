# From version 1.1.5fix1, LyX has the colours here instead
# of in Xresources.  (Version 1.1.5 can't change the colours
# at all, although 1.1.4 can.)  You can't change the cursor
# from being black in 1.1.5 (fix1+).  Version 1.1.6 has a
# preferences dialogue but saving them is buggy; it's better
# in 1.1.6fix3.  I recommend using version 1.1.4, or at
# least version 1.1.6fix3.  If you do have version 1.1.5
# then uncomment the following lines.  (They are otherwise
# harmless but create warning messages.)
# (Note: Quotes are necessary in 1.1.5fix1 but not in fix2)
